# A leading '#' character is a comment line and is ignored by the formatter. Empty
# lines are also ignored.

# There are two format 'blocks' which you must define: the 'header' and the 'body'.
# To define a block, on a new line type 'BEGIN' followed by either 'HEADER' or 'BODY'.
# When you want to end the block, type 'END' followed by the block identifier.
# Every line in a block must feature the same "|" characters in the same positions.

# In each block you can access variables from the output files. Any variable normally
# accessible by the keys of a starsmashertools.lib.output.Output can be used. To
# specify that a value from the Output should be used, encapsulate it with "{}", otherwise
# it will be parsed as normal text.

# By default all values are written in cgs units, but you can modify this.

# You can insert a newline outside of block declarations by typing "NEWLINE" in between
# block declarations.
